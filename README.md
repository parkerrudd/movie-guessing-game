# The Movie Game

Welcome to The Movie Game, a fun and interactive movie guessing game. The game randomly generates a movie and it's up to you to guess what it is before you run out of tries. Each guess provides you with hints and the game keeps track of your score. Can you beat the game?

## Tools

The game is built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js and Express for the backend. The movie data is held in a MongoDB database and is retrieved using the TMDb API.
